### Background
The other day i saw a online coding interview in youtube, the task is to find the inorder successor of a given node in the binary search tree. each time when i want to interview, need re-learn these knowlegdes, after i successfully found the job will forget these knowlegde sooner or later. here i want to make myself understand internal details of tree data structure and the applications. 

* what is binary search tree?
* how to create it?
* how to traverse it?
* how to search it?

* what is a balanced tree?
* what is red-black tree?
